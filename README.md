This repository is for trying out languages and algorithms...

## Notable features

To simplify what is an interesting feature worth noting, let's use `Java 17` as our baseline. We will essentially list notable features that are not available in the standard library / not the default or are harder to get in Java 17. **It is not meant to be thorough or a X vs Y comparison**. Objectives include: better understand the programming languages by writing down what I learn, summarise the tradeoffs made by each language, get an idea of what they are very good, good, bad, very bad at.

### Ballerina

- XML as first class (literals, manipulation)
- JSON & CSV functions & types built-in
- Exhaustive error handling (errors are values)
- Union types
- Light thread
- Allow use of keyword as name when quoted `'keyword`
- No silent overflow of number arithmetics (throw runtime exception)
- Unicode characters for names



### Clojure

- No operator precedence
- Macros
- Immutability
- No silent overflow of number arithmetics (throw runtime exception)
- Transactional memory
- Operators like `+`, `*`, ... are functions
- Threading macros `->`, `->>` (aka pipe operators)
- Rationals

### C++

### D

- [UFCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax) Chaining function calls through first argument and dot: `a.greet(b)` <=> `greet(a ,b)`
- Built-in `unittest` keyword for unit tests blocks
- Contract programming
- Code coverage
- Properties `a.name()` => `a.name`
- Default parameters for functions

### Elixir

- Pipe operator `|>`

### Elm

- Pipe operators: `|>`, `<|`


### Java

### Javascript

### Julia

- Macros
- Unicode character & emojis in source code and for variable/function names
- Operators like `+`, `*`, ... are functions
- Pipe operator `|>`
- Complex numbers, rational, bigDecimals, bigInteger, matrices and operators/functions to manipulate and mix them
- Broadcasting operator `.`
